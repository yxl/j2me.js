# "FAIL" (case-sensitive) at any point in the test run.  Ideally, we'd determine
# the success/failure based on the exit code of the test run, but casperjs
# with slimerjs always returns 0, so instead we must look for the string "FAIL",
# which only occurs on test failure.

# to the parent's standard output interspersed with the output produced by
# the automation scripts (which we have to pipe, instead of letting them print
# their output directly, so we can look for "FAIL", as described above).
#
# We don't actually pipe anything into standard input, but we have to specify
# that a new pipe should be created for it, otherwise for some reason it causes
# print/sys.stdout.write in the parent process to throw the exception "IOError:
# [Errno 35] Resource temporarily unavailable" on large amounts of output.
