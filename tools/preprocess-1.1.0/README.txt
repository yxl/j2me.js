What's new?
-----------

Support has been added for preprocessing TeX, Fortran, C#, Java, Shell
script and PHP files. See the [Change Log](#changelog) below for more.


Why preprocess.py?
------------------

There are millions of templating systems out there (most of them
developed for the web). This isn't one of those, though it does share
some basics: a markup syntax for templates that are processed to give
resultant text output.  The main difference with `preprocess.py` is
that its syntax is hidden in comments (whatever the syntax for comments
maybe in the target filetype) so that the file can still have valid
syntax. A comparison with the C preprocessor is more apt.

`preprocess.py` is targetted at build systems that deal with many
types of files. Languages for which it works include: C++, Python,
Perl, Tcl, XML, JavaScript, CSS, IDL, TeX, Fortran, PHP, Java, Shell
scripts (Bash, CSH, etc.) and C#. Preprocess is usable both as a
command line app and as a Python module.

Here is how is works: All preprocessor statements are on their own
line. A preprocessor statement is a comment (as appropriate for the
language of the file being preprocessed). This way the preprocessor
statements do not make an unpreprocessed file syntactically incorrect.
For example:

    preprocess -D FEATURES=macros,scc myapp.py

will yield this transformation:

    ...                                     ...
    # #if "macros" in FEATURES
    def do_work_with_macros():              def do_work_with_macros():
        pass                                    pass
    # #else
    def do_work_without_macros():
        pass 
    # #endif
    ...                                     ...

or, with a JavaScript file:

    ...                                     ...
    // #if "macros" in FEATURES
    function do_work_with_macros() {        function do_work_with_macros() {
    }                                       }
    // #else
    function do_work_without_macros() {
    }
    // #endif
    ...                                     ...

Despite these contrived examples preprocess has proved useful for
build-time code differentiation in the
[Komodo](http://www.activestate.com/Komodo) build system -- which
includes source code in Python, JavaScript, XML, CSS, Perl, and C/C++.

The #if expression (`"macros" in FEATURES` in the example) is Python
code, so has Python's full comparison richness.  A number of
preprocessor statements are implemented:

    #define VAR [VALUE]
    #undef VAR
    #ifdef VAR
    #ifndef VAR
    #if EXPRESSION
    #elif EXPRESSION
    #else
    #endif
    #error ERROR_STRING
    #include "FILE"
    @varName@

As well, preprocess will do in-line substitution of defined variables.
Although this is currently off by default because substitution will occur
in program strings, which is not ideal. When a future version of
preprocess can lex languages being preprocessed it will NOT substitute
into program strings and substitution will be turned ON by default.

A workaround is made to resolve this issue. Variables embraced by @ will be
substitute by its value in the  emitted lines. For example if we define
NAME="Yuan Xulei", the input file:
    <p>Hello I'm @NAME@!</p>
will output:
    <p>Hello I'm Yuan Xulei!</p>

Install Notes
-------------

Download the latest `preprocess` source package, unzip it, and run `python
setup.py install`:

    unzip preprocess-1.1.0.zip
    cd preprocess-1.1.0
    python setup.py install

If your install fails then please visit [the Troubleshooting
FAQ](http://trentm.com/faq.html#troubleshooting-python-package-installation).

This will install `preprocess.py` into your Python `site-packages` and
also into your Python bin directory. If you can now run `preprocess`
and get a response then you are good to go, otherwise read on.

The *problem* is that the Python bin directory is not always on your
PATH on some operating systems -- notably Mac OS X. To finish the
install on OS X either manually move 'preprocess' to somewhere on your
PATH:

    cp preprocess.py /usr/local/bin/preprocess

or create a symlink to it (try one of these depending on your Python
version):

    ln -s /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/bin/preprocess /usr/local/bin/preprocess
    ln -s /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/bin/preprocess /usr/local/bin/preprocess

(Note: You'll probably need to prefix those commands with `sudo` and
the exact paths may differ on your system.)


Getting Started
---------------

Once you have it install, run `preprocess --help` for full usage
information:

    $ preprocess --help
    Preprocess a file.

    Command Line Usage:
        preprocess [<options>...] <infile>

    Options:
        -h, --help      Print this help and exit.
        -V, --version   Print the version info and exit.
        -v, --verbose   Give verbose output for errors.

        -o <outfile>    Write output to the given file instead of to stdout.
        -f, --force     Overwrite given output file. (Otherwise an IOError
                        will be raised if <outfile> already exists.
        -D <define>     Define a variable for preprocessing. <define>
                        can simply be a variable name (in which case it
                        will be true) or it can be of the form
                        <var>=<val>. An attempt will be made to convert
                        <val> to an integer so "-D FOO=0" will create a
                        false value.
        -I <dir>        Add an directory to the include path for
                        #include directives.

        -k, --keep-lines    Emit empty lines for preprocessor statement
                        lines and skipped output lines. This allows line
                        numbers to stay constant.
        -s, --substitute    Substitute defines into emitted lines. By
                        default substitution is NOT done because it
                        currently will substitute into program strings.

    Module Usage:
        from preprocess import preprocess
        preprocess(infile, outfile=sys.stdout, defines={}, force=0,
                   keepLines=0, includePath=[], substitute=0)

    The <infile> can be marked up with special preprocessor statement lines
    of the form:
        <comment-prefix> <preprocessor-statement> <comment-suffix>
    where the <comment-prefix/suffix> are the native comment delimiters for
    that file type. 


    Examples
    --------

    HTML (*.htm, *.html) or XML (*.xml, *.kpf, *.xul) files:

        <!-- #if FOO -->
        ...
        <!-- #endif -->

    Python (*.py), Perl (*.pl), Tcl (*.tcl), Ruby (*.rb), Bash (*.sh),
    or make ([Mm]akefile*) files:

        # #if defined('FAV_COLOR') and FAV_COLOR == "blue"
        ...
        # #elif FAV_COLOR == "red"
        ...
        # #else
        ...
        # #endif

    C (*.c, *.h), C++ (*.cpp, *.cxx, *.cc, *.h, *.hpp, *.hxx, *.hh),
    Java (*.java), PHP (*.php) or C# (*.cs) files:

        // #define FAV_COLOR 'blue'
        ...
        /* #ifndef FAV_COLOR */
        ...
        // #endif

    Fortran 77 (*.f) or 90/95 (*.f90) files:

        C     #if COEFF == 'var'
              ...
        C     #endif


    Preprocessor Syntax
    -------------------

    - Valid statements:
        #define <var> [<value>]
        #undef <var>
        #ifdef <var>
        #ifndef <var>
        #if <expr>
        #elif <expr>
        #else
        #endif
        #error <error string>
        #include "<file>"
      where <expr> is any valid Python expression.
    - The expression after #if/elif may be a Python statement. It is an
      error to refer to a variable that has not been defined by a -D
      option or by an in-content #define.
    - Special built-in methods for expressions:
        defined(varName)    Return true if given variable is defined.  


    Tips
    ----

    A suggested file naming convention is to let input files to
    preprocess be of the form <basename>.p.<ext> and direct the output
    of preprocess to <basename>.<ext>, e.g.:
        preprocess -o foo.py foo.p.py
    The advantage is that other tools (esp. editors) will still
    recognize the unpreprocessed file as the original language.


And, for module usage, read the preprocess.preprocess() docstring:

    pydoc preprocess.preprocess


Change Log
----------

### v1.1.0
- Move to code.google.com/p/preprocess for code hosting.
- Re-org directory structure to assist with deployment to pypi and
  better installation with setup.py.
- Pulled the "content.types" file that assists with filetype
  determination into "preprocess.py". This makes "preprocess.py" fully
  independent and also makes the "setup.py" simpler. The
  "-c|--content-types-path" option can be used to specify
  addition content types information.

### v1.0.9
- Fix the 'contentType' optional arg for #include's.
- Add cheap XML content sniffing.

### v1.0.8
- Allow for JS and CSS-style comment delims in XML/HTML. Ideally this
  would deal with full lexing but that isn't going to happen soon.

### v1.0.7
- Allow explicit specification of content type.
### v1.0.6
- Add ability to include a filename mentioned in a define: '#include
  VAR'.


### v1.0.5
- Make sure to use the *longest* define names first when doing
  substitutions. This ensure that substitution in this line:
        FOO and BAR are FOOBAR
  will do the right thing if there are "FOO" and "FOOBAR" defines.

### v1.0.4
- Add WiX XML file extensions.
- Add XSLT file extensions.

### v1.0.3
- TeX support (from Hans Petter Langtangen)

### v1.0.2
- Fix a bug with -k|--keep-lines and preprocessor some directives in
  ignored if blocks (undef, define, error, include): those lines were
  not kept. (bug noted by Eric Promislow)

### v1.0.1
- Fix documentation error for '#define' statement. The correct syntax
  is '#define VAR [VALUE]' while the docs used to say
  '#define VAR[=VALUE]'. (from Hans Petter Langtangen)
- Correct '! ...' comment-style for Fortran -- the '!' can be on any
  column in Fortran 90. (from Hans Petter Langtangen)
- Return a non-zero exit code on error.

### v1.0.0
- Update the test suite (it had been broken for quite a while) and add
  a Fortran test case.
- Improve Fortran support to support any char in the first column to
  indicate a comment. (Idea from Hans Petter Langtangen)
- Recognize '.f90' files as Fortran. (from Hans Petter Langtangen)
- Add Java, C#, Shell script and PHP support. (from Hans Petter
  Langtangen)

### v0.9.2
- Add Fortran support (from Hans Petter Langtangen)
- Ensure content.types gets written to "bindir" next to preprocess.py
  there so it can be picked up (from Hans Petter Langtangen).

### v0.9.1
- Fully read in the input file before processing. This allows
  preprocessing of a file onto itself.

### v0.9.0
- Change version attributes and semantics. Before: had a _version_
  tuple. After: __version__ is a string, __version_info__ is a tuple.

### v0.8.1
- Mentioned #ifdef and #ifndef in documentation (these have been there
  for a while).
- Add preprocess.exe to source package (should fix installation on
  Windows).
- Incorporate Komodo changes:
    - change 171050: add Ruby support
    - change 160914: Only attempt to convert define strings from the
      command-line to *int* instead of eval'ing as any Python
      expression: which could surprise with strings that work as
      floats.
    - change 67962: Fix '#include' directives in preprocessed files.

### v0.8.0
- Move hosting to trentm.com. Improve the starter docs a little bit.

### 0.7.0:
- Fix bug 1: Nested #if-blocks will not be properly handled.
- Add 'Text' type for .txt files and default (with a warn) unknown
  filetypes to 'Text'. Text files are defined to use to '#...'-style
  comments to allow if/else/.../endif directives as in
  Perl/Python/Tcl files.

### 0.6.1:
- Fix a bug where preprocessor statements were not ignored when not
  emitting. For example the following should _not_ cause an error:
    # #if 0
    # #error womba womba womba
    # #endif
- Fix a bug where multiple uses of preprocess.preprocess() in the
  same interpreter would erroneously re-use the same list of
  __preprocessedFiles. This could cause false detection of recursive
  #include's.
- Fix #include, broken in 0.6.0.

### 0.6.0:
- substitution: Variables can now replaced with their defined value
  in preprocessed file content. This is turned OFF by default
  because, IMO, substitution should not be done in program strings.
  I need to add lexing for all supported languages before I can do
  *that* properly. Substitution can be turned on with the
  --substitute command-line option or the subst=1 module interface
  option.
- Add support for preprocessing HTML files.

### 0.5.0:
- Add #error, #define, #undef, #ifdef and #ifndef statements.
- #include statement, -I command line option and 'includePath'
  module interface option to specify an include path
- Add __FILE__ and __LINE__ default defines.
- More strict and more helpful error messages:
    - Lines of the form "#else <expr>" and "#endif <expr>" no longer
      match.
    - error messages for illegal #if-block constructs
    - error messages for use of defined(BAR) instead of
      defined('BAR') in expressions
- New "keep lines" option to output blank lines for skipped content
  lines and preprocessor statement lines (to preserve line numbers
  in the processed file).

### 0.4.0:
- Add #elif preprocessor statement.
- Add defined() built-in, e.g. #if defined('FOO')

### 0.3.2:
- Make #if expressions Python code.
- Change "defines" attribute of preprocess.preprocess().
- Add -f|--force option to overwrite given output file.

### 0.2.0:
- Add content types for C/C++.
- Better module documentation.
- You can define *false* vars on the command line now.
- 'python setup.py install' works.

### 0.1.0:
- First release.
